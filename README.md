This Project is a 7 Layer CNN Model consisting of 3 Convolution layers each followed by a Max Pooling Layer and Fully Connected layer on Breast Ultrasound Images to classify them as Benign, Malignant and Normal stages.

- For each Convolution layer The Filter used is of size 3X3.
- We have used Relu as Activation function because it is non-linear in nature and due to its simplicity and less complexity.
- For every layer Stride(s) =1 and Padding(p) =0
- We have divided the dataset in 4:1 ratio for Model training and validation.

## Project Demo Implementation Video :


- For every Convolution layer result in CNN we use the formula
